# Women-Clothing-Review-Analysis
An Excel-based analysis of customer reviews in women’s fashion. Uncovers satisfaction drivers, demographic engagement patterns, and product-specific insights to inform marketing, merchandising, and inventory strategy.

>"Great products don’t just speak — their customers do."

## Project Overview

This project started with thousands of customer reviews — short bursts of emotion, critique, and praise — each one a clue to what really matters in fashion retail.

I didn’t want to just look at ratings. I wanted to know:

- Who speaks the loudest in fashion?
- What products actually earn loyalty?
- And how can one paragraph of feedback shape an entire marketing strategy?

This analysis explores how customer voice can guide smarter product decisions and build stronger brand relationships.

## Objective

To uncover patterns in review behavior across product divisions, age groups, and recommendation likelihood — using data to bridge the gap between brand perception and real customer experience.

---

## About the Dataset

The dataset was drawn from a U.S.-based women's clothing retailer and includes:

- Customer ratings (1–5)
- Product division and class
- Review text and length
- Age and recommendation indicators
- Feedback engagement (positive feedback count)

Each record captures a moment of reflection — and often, a buying decision.

## Data Preparation and Analysis (Excel)

I built this analysis with structured logic and intentional design using:

- **IF Statements** to classify customer age into cohorts: Youth, Adult, Senior, Elderly
- **LEN Function** to measure review depth — because longer reviews often carry richer insights
- **AVERAGE Functions** to assess satisfaction across divisions and classes
- **Pivot Tables** for segmenting by age, product type, and recommendation behavior

From raw feedback to a story you can act on — all done in Excel.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

- **Rating (1–5):** Primary measure of satisfaction
- **Recommended IND:** Proxy for brand loyalty
- **Positive Feedback Count:** Indicator of review influence and trust-building potential
- **Review Length:** Proxy for emotional investment and product impact
- **Review Volume by Age Group:** Engagement trends across life stages

---

## Core Insights

- **Tops** received the most reviews and also the highest positive feedback, totaling 10,475 mentions — a clear product strength.
- **General Division** earned 13,859 product recommendations — signaling widespread appeal and satisfaction.
- **Adults** were the most engaged reviewers across all divisions — making them the brand’s loudest and most influential demographic.
- **Trend and Jackets** had the longest reviews — suggesting stronger emotional reactions, both positive and critical.
- **Blouses and Dresses** consistently earned top ratings across all age groups — reflecting cross-generational appeal and product reliability.

## Recommendations

1. **Double down on Tops and Dresses** — they’re consistent drivers of satisfaction and generate organic engagement.
2. **Prioritize the Adult demographic** in campaigns and messaging — they write, recommend, and respond more than any other group.
3. **Leverage Positive Feedback Count** as a key metric for identifying product ambassadors and converting browsers into buyers.
4. **Target high-rated products with tailored messaging** to encourage repeat purchases and increase average order value.
5. **Monitor longer reviews on emotionally polarizing items** like Jackets and Trend apparel — they often hold key product insights or friction points.

## Final Note

Customer reviews are more than feedback — they’re forecasts.

This analysis is proof that when you listen closely to your most engaged customers, they’ll tell you exactly what’s working, what’s failing, and where your next big win is hiding.
